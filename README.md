# Tetris

### How do you play?

The idea is very simply.Each time a Tetrimino falls into the rectangular Matrix and players has to rotate, move, and drop in order to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty space.Although if the Tetriminos surpass the Skyline the game is over!
